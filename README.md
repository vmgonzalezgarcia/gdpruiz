# GDPRuiz: A GDPR data obfuscator

In order to comply with the recent General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR) sometimes you need to delete or obfuscate Personal Identifiable Information, such as email addresses or names.

The function accepts an arbitrary string and returns the string `M. Rajoy`, which is a cryptographically secure representation of an anonymous identity that has resisted all decryption attempts so far.
